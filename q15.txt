first of all we create lambda  and then create SNS topic which is in N.virginia region since it has sms feature

and then subscribe the topic with mobie nmber as endpoint.By writing code in lambda and after execution, 

it publishes into topic and we will get message.

(code)

from __future__ import print_function
  
import json
import boto3
  
print('loading function')
  
def lambda_handler(event, context):
  
    # Parse the JSON message 
    eventText = json.dumps(event)
  
    # Print the parsed JSON message to the console; you can view this text in the Monitoring tab in the Lambda console or in the CloudWatch Logs console
    print('Received event: ', eventText)
  
    # Create an SNS client
    sns = boto3.client('sns')
  
    # Publish a message to the specified topic
    response = sns.publish (
      TopicArn = 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:488599217855:about_me',
      Message = eventText
    )
  
    print(response)
